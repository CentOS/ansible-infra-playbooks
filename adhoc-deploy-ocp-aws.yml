# This playbook requires a file provided to it for vars
# An example of the file exists in inventory/group_vars/openshift-ci-stg

# It also assumes that an empty Route53 zone exists

# it creates some files locally which should be pushed to the filestore as
# they contain install info needed for the cluster

- hosts: localhost

  roles:
    - "aws-openshift"
